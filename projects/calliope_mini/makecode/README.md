# RoboCar (Calliope mini)

**Python Makecode (similar to Micropython) workshop to program a 2WD robo car.**  
Car with 2 wheels drives without hitting obstacles.  
An ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to obstacles.  
If the distance to the obstacle is too short, the robo stops,  
turns into random direction and continues driving if no obstacle  
is detected.

Needed parts:
- 2WD Robot Car
- Motor driver for 2 motors (e.g. L298N)
- Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04P (3.3V)
- calliope mini v2
- Batteries

Copy needed file to Makecode-Python web page of Calliope mini V2:
- mini-v2_robo_car.hex
or as text file
- robo_car.py
